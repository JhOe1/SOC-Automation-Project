# SOC Automation Project

This project involves automating the Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using **Wazuh**, **Shuffle**, and **TheHive**.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance SOC efficiency by integrating and automating critical processes through open-source tools. By leveraging Wazuh for threat detection, Shuffle for workflow automation, and TheHive for incident response, this setup aims to create a streamlined and responsive SOC environment.

## Tools Used

### Wazuh  
**Wazuh** is a free, open-source security platform that unifies Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities.  
Key Features:  
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies potential security threats across systems.  
- **Compliance**: Helps organizations meet regulatory and security compliance requirements.  
- **Incident Handling**: Aids in managing and responding to security incidents.  
- **Integrity Monitoring**: Tracks and monitors file and system integrity.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures alignment with various regulatory frameworks.

### Shuffle  
**Shuffle Automation** is an open-source platform designed to automate security processes and workflows.  
Key Features:  
- Allows the definition of automated workflows to improve infrastructure security.  
- Integrates with REST APIs of security tools, enabling seamless communication and action between them.  
- Enhances efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.

---

### TheHive  
**TheHive** is a free, open-source Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP) used for investigating and managing security incidents.  
Key Features:  
- Enables analysts to add observables to cases and use tags for categorization.  
- Facilitates the identification of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).  
- Supports collaborative investigation and documentation of security incidents.
